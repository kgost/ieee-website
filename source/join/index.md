While all students are welcome in the lab, to take full advantage of the lab and its equipment, you must become a member.

To join you must:
1. Join IEEE international online at [https://www.ieee.org//membership/join/index.html](https://www.ieee.org//membership/join/index.html)
2. Watch this saftey video [https://huskycast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=94884cc5-cf35-48d0-93e9-b369b72ccbb7](https://huskycast.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=94884cc5-cf35-48d0-93e9-b369b72ccbb7)
3. **Agree to follow the safety procedures laid out in the video at all times when in the lab. These are rules, not guidelines.**
4. Email [jmfritsc@mtu.edu](mailto:ieee@mtu.edu?Subject=IEEE%20Lab%20Swipe%20Access%20&%20Safety%20Training) with the subject `IEEE Lab Swipe Access & Safety Training` stating some aspect of safety that you learned from the video, as well as the following (and please use this as a template for the convenience of the faculty who have to process swipe access)
```
